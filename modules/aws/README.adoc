= AWS Module

Within our XTDB node, we can make use of **AWS S3** as one of the XTDB Object Stores used by the remote storage module.

== Project Dependency

In order to use S3 as an object store, you will need to include a dependency on the xtdb.aws module:

.deps.edn
[source,clojure]
----
com.xtdb/xtdb-aws {:mvn/version "2.x-SNAPSHOT"}
----

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.xtdb</groupId>
    <artifactId>xtdb-aws</artifactId>
    <version>2.x-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

== CloudFormation Stack

In order to handle the various bits of AWS infrastructure required to use S3 as an XTDB object store, we provide a link:cloudformation/s3-stack.yml[parameterized CloudFormation stack] to setup everything that you should need.

=== Inputs to the stack

The paramaterized stack expects the following to be provided:

* The name of S3 Bucket that will be used by the created object store bucket and referenced in associated resources
** If unset, uses a default value of `xtdb-object-store`

=== Created Resources

The CloudFormation stack will create the following resources within the specified region in AWS:

* The S3 bucket, with the user configured bucket name.
* An IAM Role, with all of the relevant permissions for:
** Using the created S3 bucket (Get, Put, Delete and List).

=== Outputs

Using the CloudFormation template will output a number of things, some of which will be needed configuring your node:

* The S3 Bucket Name (**this will be used in config**)
* ARN of the created XTDB IAM Role (this, or something with equivalent permissions, will be required to use all of the above)

== Authentication

Authentication for both the document store and checkpoint store components within the module is handled via the S3 API, which in turn uses the Default AWS Credential Provider Chain.
See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default[AWS documentation] on the various methods which you can handle authentication to be able to make use of the operations inside the modules.

Within the provided CloudFormation stack, we create an XTDB IAM role.
One can use this role to provide all necessary permissions for XTDB and the resources it is using on AWS, otherwise you will need to ensure whichever credentials you are using to authenticate XTDB have the same level of permissions to the miscellaneous services.
See the IAM policy set on the XTDBIamRole in the link:cloudformation/s3-stack.yml[CloudFormation stack] for what exactly that includes.

== S3 Object Store config

We can swap out the implementation of the object store with one based on S3. To do so, we can add the `:s3` object store and it's configuration map, within the remote storage module config for our node:

[source,clojure]
----
{:storage [:remote {:object-store [:s3 {:bucket "xtdb-object-store"}]}]

 ;; required for remote storage
 :disk-cache {:path "local-disk-cache"}}
----

=== Parameters

These are the following parameters that can be passed within the config for our `xtdb.s3/object-store`:
[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
| *Name* | *Type* | *Description* | *Required?*
| `bucket`
| String 
| The name of the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html[S3 Bucket] to use an an object store
| Yes

|`prefix`
| String/File/Path
| A file path to prefix all of your files with - for example, if "foo" is provided all xtdb files will be located under a "foo" directory
| No

| `configurator`
| `S3Configurator`
| The https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/main/modules/s3/src/main/java/xtdb/aws/s3/S3Configurator.java[`xtdb.aws.s3.S3Configurator`] with extra s3 configuration options to be used by the object store
| Yes
|=== 

=== Configuring S3 requests

WARNING: This is unfortunately currently only accessible from Clojure - we plan to expose it outside of Clojure soon.

While the above is sufficient to get `xtdb-aws` working out of the box, there are a plethora of configuration options in S3 - how to get credentials, object properties, serialisation of the documents, etc.
We expose these via the https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/main/modules/s3/src/main/java/xtdb/aws/s3/S3Configurator.java[`xtdb.aws.s3.S3Configurator`] interface - you can supply an instance using the following in your node configuration.

Through this interface, you can supply an `S3AsyncClient` for xtdb-aws to use, adapt the `PutObjectRequest`/`GetObjectRequest` as required, and choose the serialisation format.
By default, we get credentials through the usual AWS credentials provider.
